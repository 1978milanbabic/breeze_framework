/*
**      Breeze is a CSS/JS responsive framework built on a jQuery library
**      
**      CSS is used only for specific classes and this framework DOES NOT overrides custom CSS and default behaviour
**      like Bootstrap or similar frameworks - all the classes are up to developer to use them or not
**      
**      The issues that Breese is handling are:
**      - overcoming the problems caused by the difference between css window "width" size and javascript window width size
**        caused by the browsers sliders width
**      - loading images only once (responsive design issue) per device load - no new loads of sets of pics on 
**        window resize for one device caused
**      - Effects
